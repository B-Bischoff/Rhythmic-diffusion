The <B>Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)</B> is a set of open source
audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in
the C++ programming language.  STK was designed to facilitate rapid
development of music synthesis and audio processing software, with an
emphasis on cross-platform functionality, realtime control, ease of
use, and educational example code.  The Synthesis ToolKit is extremely
portable (it's mostly platform-independent C and C++ code), and it's
completely user-extensible (all source included, no unusual libraries,
and no hidden drivers).  We like to think that this increases the
chances that our programs will still work in another 5-10 years.  In
fact, the ToolKit has been working continuously for nearly 20 years
now.  STK currently runs with realtime support (audio and MIDI) on
Linux, Macintosh OS X, and Windows computer platforms.  Generic,
non-realtime support has been tested under NeXTStep, Sun, and other
platforms and should work with any standard C++ compiler.
