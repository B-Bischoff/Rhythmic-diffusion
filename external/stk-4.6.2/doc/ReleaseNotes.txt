- pulled various utility and thread functions out of syntmono.cpp (to aid readability of the code)


v2.02: (16 November 1998)
- created RawWave abstract class, with subclasses of RawLoop (looping rawwave oscillator), RawShot (non-looping, non-interpolating rawwave player ... used to be RawWvIn), and RawInterp (looping or non-looping, interpolating rawwave player ... used to be RawWave).
- modified DrumSynt to correctly handle sample rates different than 22050 Hz.
- modified syntmono parsing vs. tick routine so that some ticking occurs between each message.  When multiple messages are waiting to be processed, the time between message updates is inversely proportional to the number of messages in the buffer.
- fixed DirectSound playback bug in Win distribution.  Sound was being played at 8-bit, 22 kHz in all cases.  Playback is now 16-bit and dependent on SRATE.

- More linux support and other changes that happened so long ago that I can't remember anymore.  Never officially released.


v1.0:
- Linux support added with the help of Tim Stilson.  Never officially released.


v0.8:
- One of (if not THE) original distributions for SGI, NeXTStep, and basic Win support.  I think this came out in 1996.
